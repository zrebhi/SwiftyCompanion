## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.exemple`:
   - Run the command: `cp .env.exemple .env`.
   

3. **Configure API access:**

* **Option A: Use pre-deployed API** (Recommended, no credentials needed)
  - In your `.env` file, set `PROJECT_LOCAL_API=false`
  - This uses our hosted API proxy at `https://swifty-api.vercel.app`

* **Option B: Run your own API** (Requires 42 API credentials)
  - In your `.env` file:
    - Set `PROJECT_LOCAL_API=true`
    - Set `IP_ADDRESS` to your local IP address
    - Add your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the 42 API
    - 42 members can obtain these credentials from the [42 API Getting Started Guide](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/guides/getting_started)

4. **Run the application:**
   - Execute the script `./run-app.sh` to start the application.


## Architecture

The project consists of two main components:
- **Mobile App**: React Native/Expo application for the frontend
- **API Proxy**: A Node.js serverless function that securely handles 42 API authentication
  - When `PROJECT_LOCAL_API=false`: Uses our pre-deployed proxy on Vercel
  - When `PROJECT_LOCAL_API=true`: Runs the proxy locally in a Docker container (requires your own 42 API credentials)
